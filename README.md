# Statistical analysis of top CS Universities

## Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to gather data from [CS Rankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&world)<br/>
which is a metrics-based ranking of top computer science institutions around the world.

The data we gathered are the information of the university rankings, 
count(Geometric mean count of papers published across all areas)
and number of faculties published papers in our areas of concern.

We used these scraped data to find some correlations in tableau dashboard:
1. Top universities in the world
2. Top universities with most faculties
3. Average ranking of universities per country

## From our findings in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abrar.faiaz.adnan/viz/CSrankingsdemoproject/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
1. American Universities have highest ranks
2. American Universities also have the highest number of faculties
3. In average rankings of the top universities per country Brazil, Norway, Finland,Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Greece, Turkey, Iran, UAE has average rating of over 300
